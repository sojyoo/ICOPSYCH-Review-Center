  title: 'Lecture 1: Human Development and Research Methodology',
  overview:
    'Introduces foundational viewpoints on human development, core domains and periods of growth, key developmental issues, and ethical research practices used in psychology.',
  highlightPoints: [
    'Development is continuous, multidimensional, and shaped by both biology and context.',
    'Historical perspectives (nativism vs. empiricism) still influence how we view growth today.',
    'Sound research design and ethics are essential for studying lifespan development.'

  sections: [
    {
      heading: 'Early Concepts of Human Nature',
      bullets: [
        'Nativism suggests most abilities are inborn (Augustine’s original sin; Rousseau’s innate goodness).',
        'Empiricism sees the mind as a blank slate shaped entirely by experience (John Locke).'

        'Developmental Psychology studies continuity and change across the lifespan.',

      bullets: [
        'Domains: Physical, Cognitive, Psychosocial (each influenced by culture).',

      heading: 'Life-Span Developmental Approach',
      bullets: [
        'Development is lifelong, multidimensional, multidirectional, and shows plasticity.',
        'Contextual: co-constructed by biology, culture, and individual choices.',
        'Involves shifting resource allocations across the lifespan.'

        'Nature (heredity, maturation) vs. Nurture (environment, learning).',
        'Universal vs. Context-specific pathways; Biopsychosocial framework integrates forces.'
